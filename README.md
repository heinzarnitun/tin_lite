Tin Lite is a simple social client app developed using Flutter. 
The main idea behind this app is to let users create, read, update and delete messages offline on their mobile phones. Users can also attach images using built-in camera or from gallery to the messages and later upload them to social media platform, Twitter, when internet is available. 
The app name Tin Lite is inspired by Burmese phrase “Tin Lite” (တင်လိုက်) which means “Let’s post it” in English. The purpose of the app is just like the meaning of the name that is to prepare the user’s post even offline, and upload when they are ready.

App Logo Explanation
	The app logo is designed based on the Burmese alphabets “တ” (ta) and “လ” (la) which are the initial of the words “Tin” and “Lite”. The shape is created in the way that keeps the feel of Burmese characters but also with a modern and minimal design. It reflects the local identity and also gives a unique touch to the branding of the app.
